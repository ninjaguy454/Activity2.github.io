			<p> Hello there, my name is Duane Severson and I'm a full-time student, full-time QAQC Coordinator at the
			PNB datacenter and full-time proud father of 2 girls and 1 boy who's arriving in July. Although I certainly am
			a bit anxious about taking these summer courses, I feel fairly confident I can power through them.</p></div>

			<h2 id="right">About this site!</h2>
			<p>Through much trial and error it seems as though I've managed to recollect my 
			HTML and CSS coding abilities and cobble together a humble landing page! I'll have you know, getting 
			glazed ice simulated for the background held me up for quite a while. Perhaps not the best idea to get 
			ambitious when you barely remember the material ahaha! Well, thanks for reading! Feel free to check out the link to my second page below my name </p></div>

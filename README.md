 Github repo for Activity 2 for ISQA3900

<!Thank you for your interest in my site! This was certainly a challenging project for me, but it was a great refresher and there's just a ton of stuff I've learned from it. I hope you enjoy the site as much as I do now that it's complete.!>

<!This repo consists of 2 HTMLs and an index.md file. The Homepage data is essentially copied to the index.md file which Github uses to host the site. This should still allow me to link the 2 sites together so you have a simple, mildly entertaining browsing experience.!>

<!The Homepage is just a short "About me" page that I put together. I mostly was trying to experiment with CSS since my time with CSS and Perl was cut short in Spring '20 due to COVID. I challenged myself with that 2010's frosted glass aesthetic look that's become nearly ubiquitous in UI design.!>

<!The 2nd page was certainly less demanding acting more as a proof that I know how to link sites together. I speng so much time working on page one I just feel burnt out thinking about the 2nd one.!>

<!Well anyway, thanks again! I hope you enjoy!!>
